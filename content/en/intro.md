I've been blogging for 3 years now.
From the initial journey: Hexo -> Vuepress -> Vitepress -> Nuxt.js
The adventure continues.
## Motivation
I wanted to create a blog to document all the problems I encountered during development and the knowledge I learned along the way. I also wanted to share some insights gained from developmentâ€”it's like finding inner peace(!?), which helps me better face challenges and learning opportunities. My goal is to create a platform where I can share knowledge and experiences, where we can learn and grow together. I'll share observed technology trends, best practices, problem-solving approaches, and more. I hope everyone will enjoy it! Expanding my knowledge domains and continuous learning!
## Vision
Beyond documenting the development process, I hope this blog can also share my life experiences, including learning, growth, challenges, and achievements. At the same time, I want to use this blog to look toward the future, sharing my dreams, plans, and aspirations from the perspective of someone without a traditional CS background, encouraging readers to actively pursue their own goals and dreams. I believe such sharing and exchange will make this blog more valuable and meaningful, and will be able to inspire and help more people.
